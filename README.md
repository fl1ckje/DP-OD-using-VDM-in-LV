# Deep Learning object detection using Vision Development Module in LabVIEW
This repository contains VI for deep learning object detection using TensorFlow high-level API.
Requirements: LabVIEW 2018 Full/Professional 64-bit 2018 and Visual Development Module 65-bit 2018 or newer.
For a quick start you have just to set up some TF HL API parameters, choose a folder with some stuff to test and choose your frozen inference graph. Personally, I use SSD Mobile Net v2 (cause it's lightweight and relatively fast among other popular OD models), but you can use your own. E.g., ResNet or faster R-CNN.
If you want to use the frozen graph from this repo, first of all, you must unzip it (initial size is bigger than 25 MB, so I have to zip it).
