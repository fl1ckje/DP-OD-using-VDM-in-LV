# Deep Learning object detection using Vision Development Module in LabVIEW
This repository contains VI for deep learning object detection using TensorFlow high-level API.
For a quick start you have just to set up some TF HL API parameters, choose a folder with some stuff to test and choose your frozen inference graph. Personally, I use SSS Mobile Net v2 (cause it's lightweight and relatively fast among other popular OD models).
